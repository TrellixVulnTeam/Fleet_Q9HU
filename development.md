#Extension and debugs:

* Should vehicles wait for travelers?
* Use driving distances between two points (i.g. Google Map)
* Consider a waiting time tolerance for each trip after which the trip is missed
* Count missed trips
* Consider public and owned CSs
* Calculate charging cost and revenue 
* We can consider different size of vehicles
* We can consider different trips (pooling, multi-destination)
* V2G connection 
* We should measure waiting time, impact on the grid and REG utilization (First, we need to add REG to the model)
* In this scenario we just assign idle vehicles to trips. In further, we could consider active vehicles too, because 
    maybe one of these active vehicles would be the best choice.
